    "Unfortunately for the Kruskal-Wallis test there is not a single agreed upon effect size measure. However Epsilon square (ε<sup>2</sup>) (Kelley, 1935) seems to be a good choice (see King & Minium (2009), as cited in Tomczak & Tomczak, 2014).\n",

    "An epsilon square of 0 would mean no differences (and no influence), while one of 1 would indicate a full dependency. Unfortunately there is no formal way to determine if 0.40 is high or low, and I have not been able to find any rule of thumbs for the interpretation. Since this is a squared variable, I would use the same rule of thumb as for a correlation coefficient, but then squaring the upper and lower bounds of each bin. This would give if we use from Rea and Parker (2014) their interpretation for r, the following:\n",
